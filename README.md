# CSE Student Strength Predictor

## Project Description

Welcome to the CSE Student Strength Predictor, an innovative tool designed to estimate the academic strength of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) undergraduate students based on their course grades. This project aims to assist educators, students, and academic institutions in understanding and assessing the performance and potential of CSE students.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to provide valuable insights into the academic progress of CSE students. Understanding a student's strengths can help educators tailor their teaching methods to individual needs, offer timely support to struggling students, and recognize outstanding achievements. Additionally, this tool can aid students in tracking their academic growth and making informed decisions about their education.

## Predictor System

Our predictor system leverages machine learning models to make accurate predictions about a student's academic strength. By inputting the grades for a set of 25 courses, users can instantly receive predictions that fall into five distinct categories:

- **Average:** For students whose grades indicate a moderate level of academic performance.
- **Medium:** Reflecting a slightly above-average academic standing.
- **Good:** Indicating a strong academic record.
- **Very Good:** Reserved for students with excellent academic achievements.
- **Excellent:** The highest category, signifying exceptional academic prowess.

The system employs logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting models to ensure precise and reliable predictions. Users can explore and compare the outcomes generated by each model.

## Collaborators

This project was developed through collaboration among (https://github.com/RJ-Hossan), (https://github.com/TofayelAhmmedBabu), and (https://github.com/ma5bah). We aimed to create a user-friendly and insightful tool that benefits both educators and students.
